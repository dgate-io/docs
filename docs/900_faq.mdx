### How can I contribute to DGate?

- Creating issues or pull requests on the [DGate repository](https://github.com/dgate-io/dgate)

## Is DGate compatible with Node JS or any other JS runtimes?

Unfortunately, no...

### Why is DGate request latency high?

DGate is a proxy server that sits between a client and the upstream service(s).
The latency could be higher than expected due to the following reasons:
- Network latency between the client and DGate
- Network latency between DGate and the upstream service
- DGate Transport Settings (which can limit the number of connections, etc.)
- DGate Modules (having unoptimized or too many modules can increase latency)
