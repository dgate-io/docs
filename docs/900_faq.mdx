### How can I get support for DGate?

You can get support for DGate by:
- Creating issues or pull requests on the [DGate repository](https://github.com/dgate-io/dgate)


### How can I use external packages in DGate modules?

We do not currently support external packages in DGate modules.
- All modules and package dependencies must be included in the module's payload.
- We are working on a solution to support external packages in the future.

### Why is DGate request latency high?

DGate is a proxy server that sits between a client and the upstream service(s).
The latency could be higher than expected due to the following reasons:
- Network latency between the client and DGate
- Network latency between DGate and the upstream service
- DGate Transport Settings (which can limit the number of connections, etc.)
- DGate Modules (having unoptimized or too many modules can increase latency)
