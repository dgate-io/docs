Documents are data that is stored in the database, and can be accessed and manipulated using the API. Documents are stored in collections, and each document has a unique identifier.

Unlike other resources in DGate, documents do not have namespaces or tags. They are stored and accessed in modules.

## Document Structure

```json
{
    "id": "document1",
    "collection": "collection1",
    "data": {
        "field1": "value1",
        "field2": "value2",
    },
    "namespace": "namespace1",
}
```
