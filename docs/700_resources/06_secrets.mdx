Secrets are a way to store sensitive information in your application. You can use them to store API keys, passwords, and other sensitive information.

Once a secret is created, it can be used in your application by referencing it in your code. Secrets can not be retrieved via the Admin API (or CLI) once they are created.

## Secret Structure

```json
{
    "name": "secret1",
    "namespace": "namespace1",
    "data": "secret",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
}
```

## Secret Fields

### `name!`

The name of the secret.

### `data!`

The data of the secret.

### `namespace`

The namespace that the secret belongs to.

### `tags`

The tags associated with the secret. Read me about tags [here](/docs/concepts/tags).
