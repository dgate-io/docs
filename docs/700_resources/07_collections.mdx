Collections are a way to group Documents and provide a schema for Documents to follow. Each Documents belongs to a Collection, and each Collection belongs to a Namespace.

## Collection Structure

```json
{
    "name": "collection1",
    "namespace": "namespace1",
    "visibility": "public",
    "type": "document",

    "schema": {
        "field1": "string",
        "field2": "number",
    },
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
}
```

## Collection Fields

### `name!`

The name of the Collection.

### `namespace!`

The namespace that the Collection belongs to.

### `visibility!`

The visibility of the Collection. Can be `public` or `private`.

### `type!`

The type of the Collection. Can be `document`.

### `schema!`

The schema of the Collection. This is an object that defines the fields and types of the fields that each Document in the Collection must have.

### `tags`

The tags associated with the Collection. Read me about tags [here](/docs/concepts/tags).
