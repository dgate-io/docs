Services are an abstraction of upstream services. They are used to define the connection details and settings for the upstream service.

## Service Structure

```json
{
    "name": "service1",
    "urls": ["http://example.com/v1", "http://example.net/v1"],
    "namespace": "namespace1",
    "retries": 3,
    "retryTimeout": "5s",
    "connectTimeout": "1s",
    "requestTimeout": "5s",
    "tlsSkipVerify": false,
    "http2Only": false,
    "hideDGateHeaders": false,
    "disableQueryParams": false,
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

## Service Fields

### `name!`

The name of the service.

### `urls!`

The URLs of the upstream service. Multiple URLs can be provided to allow for load balancing and failover.

### `namespace`

The namespace that the service belongs to.

### `retries`

The number of times to retry a request to the upstream service if it fails. Default is `3`.

### `retryTimeout`

The time to wait before retrying a request to the upstream service. Default is `5s`.

### `connectTimeout`

The time to wait before timing out a connection to the upstream service. Default is `1s`.

### `requestTimeout`

The time to wait before timing out a request to the upstream service. Default is `5s`.

### `tlsSkipVerify`

If `true`, DGate will skip verifying the TLS certificate of the upstream service. Default is `false`.

### `http2Only`

If `true`, DGate will only use HTTP/2 to communicate with the upstream service. Default is `false`.

### `hideDGateHeaders`

If `true`, DGate will not send its headers to the upstream service. Default is `false`.

### `disableQueryParams`

If `true`, DGate will not forward query parameters to the upstream service. Default is `false`.

### `tags`

Tags that the service belongs to. Tags can be used for access control, canary, etc. Read me about tags [here](/docs/concepts/tags).
