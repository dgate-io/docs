Domains are way are a way to control ingress traffic into specific namespaces in DGate.

## Domain Structure

```json
{
    "name": "domain1",
    "namespace": "namespace1",
    "patterns": ["/route1"],
    "priority": 1,
    "cert": "cert1",
    "key": "key1",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
}
```

## Domain Fields

### `name!`

The name of the domain.

### `namespace`

The namespace that the domain belongs to.

### `patterns!`

Paths that the domain should match. The path can contain wildcards (`*`) to match multiple paths.

Pattern matching is also supported. If the path is `/route/{id}`, it will match `/route/abc123`, etc. The route parameters will be available for use in modules by using this (function)[TODO-LINK]

These can also be extended using regular expressions, if you only want to catch specific patterns. If the path is `/route/{id:[0-9]+}`, it will match `/route/1`, `/route/123`, etc.

### `priority`

The priority of the domain. Domains with higher priority will be matched first.

### `cert`

The certificate to use for the domain.

### `key`

The private key to use for the domain.

### `tags`

The tags associated with the domain. Read me about tags [here](/docs/concepts/tags).
