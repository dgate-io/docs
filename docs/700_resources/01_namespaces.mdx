Namespaces are a way to organize your resources in DGate. They are used to group resources together and provide a way to manage access control and policies for those resources.

Each resource in DGate belongs to a namespace (except [Documents](/docs/resources/documents)). Resource that are not in the same namespace cannot be accessed by each other.

Each resource that has a namespace also has tags, namespaces also have tags.

At the moment, tags don't have much functionality, but they may be used in the future for permissions, canary, server tag based resource management, etc.

## Namespace Structure

```json
{
    "name": "namespace1",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
}
```

## Namespace Fields

### `name!`

The name of the namespace.

### `tags`

The tags associated with the namespace. Read more about tags [here](/docs/concepts/tags).
