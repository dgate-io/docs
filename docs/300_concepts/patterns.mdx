Domain Patterns are used in multiple places in DGate (domains configuration, allow domains app configuration, etc.) to match patern


## Pattern Types

### Direct matching

Direct matching is the simplest form of pattern matching. The domain must match the pattern exactly.

### Wildcards

Wildcards are used to match multiple paths. The wildcard character is `*`.

Wildcards can be used in a few ways:

- `*` - matches any path
- `*foo` - matches any path that ends with `foo`
- `foo*` - matches any path that starts with `foo`
- `*foo*` - matches any path that contains `foo`

### Regular Expressions

Regular expressions can be used to match specific patterns. The pattern must be enclosed in `/`.

- `/^.+\.example.com$/` - matches any subdomain of `example.com`
- `/^example\.com$/` - matches `example.com` exactly
