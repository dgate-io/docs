Tags are a way to categorize and organize your resources in DGate. They are used to group resources together and provide a way to manage access control and policies for those resources.

Tags can also be used in more complex ways like permissions, canary, server tag based resource management, etc. Each resource in DGate has tags (except [Documents](/docs/resources/documents))

## Tag Structure

```json
{
    ...
    "tags": ["tag2", "tag3"],
}
```
