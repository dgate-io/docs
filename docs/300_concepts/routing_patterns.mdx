title: Routing Patterns
---

Routing Patterns in DGate are used to match incoming requests to specific modules.

DGate uses [go-chi routing](https://go-chi.io/#/pages/routing) under the hood, which supports a variety of routing patterns.

## Pattern Types

### Direct matching

Direct matching is the simplest form of pattern matching. The domain must match the pattern exactly.

- `/` will only match `/`.
- `/route` will only match `/route`.
- `/route/` will only match `/route/`.

### Wildcard matching

Wildcards are used to match multiple paths. The wildcard character is `*`.

- `/route/*` will match `/route/abc`, `/route/123`, `/route/`, etc.
- `/route/*` will not match `/route`
- `/route/*/` will match `/route/abc/`, `/route/abc/123/`, `/route/`, etc.

### Routing Parameters

Routing parameters are used to match specific patterns. The pattern must be enclosed in `{}`.

- `/route/{id}` will match `/route/abc123`, etc.
- `/route/{month}-{year}` will match `/route/10-2020`, etc.
- `/route/{id}/{name}` will match `/route/abc123/xyz`, etc.

### Regular Expressions

Regular expressions can be combined with routing parameters to match specific patterns.

- `/route/{id:[0-9]+}` will match `/route/1`, `/route/123`, etc.
- `/route/{id:[a-z]+}` will match `/route/abc`, `/route/xyz`, etc.
- `/route/{id:[a-z0-9]+}` will match `/route/abc123`, `/route/xyz123`, etc.


:::tip
When using modules, the slug can be used to get the part of the path that was matched by the pattern.

For example, if the path is `/route/{id}`, the slug `id` can be used to get the value of the `id` parameter. If the path is `/route/*`, the slug `*` can be used to get the value of the wildcard.

```typescript
function testFunction(ctx: ModuleContext) {
    const id = ctx.pathParam('id'); // returns matched value of {id} or undefined
    ...
}
```
